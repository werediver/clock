# Clock

This [Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)-based clock uses a dedicated oscillator for the built-in RP2040 [RTC](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf#section_rtc), features capacitive touch-sensing buttons, and a custom built-in NiMH charging circuit.

The estimated run-time on a single charge is _one week_ (yes, _just_ one week).
